Instructions for creating and using a virtual environment for this program:

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   - Run the following command in the terminal to create a virtual environment (replace `my_env` with any name you prefer):
     ```
     python3 -m venv my_env
     ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - For macOS or Linux, use the following command to activate the environment:
     ```
     source my_env/bin/activate
     ```
   - For Windows, use this command:
     ```
     my_env\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install the `translate` package**:
   - After activating the virtual environment, install the `translate` package with pip:
     ```
     pip install translate
     ```

4. **Run your Python script**:
   - With the virtual environment active, run the script normally:
     ```
     python translator.py
     ```

5. **Deactivate the virtual environment**:
   - Once you are done, deactivate the virtual environment with the following command:
     ```
     deactivate
     ```

This ensures that the `translate` package is installed in an isolated environment without affecting your system-wide Python packages.

# Rules for naming variables
# 1. Variable names can't start with a number
# 2. Variable names can't contain spaces, use _ instead
# 3. Variable names can't contain any of these symbols: :'",<>/?|\!@#%^&*~-+
# 4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that variable names are lowercase with underscores
# 5. Avoid using Python built-in keywords like print and str
# 6. Use descriptive variable names to avoid confusion
